## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Huge fight when tried to use form instead of plain buttons. Way to go was with use of buttons and
scripting whole selection logic.

I learned that I can use data attributes to pass values to JS. `data-value` attribute can be read
with use of `dataset` in JS. I found it extremely useful to pass marks values.
```html
<button class="mark" data-value="1">1</button>
```
```js
const value = markBtn.dataset.value;
```

### Continued development

I want to add some animation to give this component some more life.
